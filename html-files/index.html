    <h1>🎉 Welcome to the Git and GitHub Workshop! 🎉</h1>

    <p>Are you ready to learn how to break the internet? Just kidding, let’s start with the basics. Grab your coffee (or your therapist) because you’ll need it to survive the next few hours. 🚀</p>
    <p>Your first task is simple: Fork this repository (don’t worry, it’s not as painful as a fork in the road), clone it, and add your <strong>amazing</strong> index page (complete with your name, university, and enough humor to make even the darkest pull request seem bearable)!</p>

    <h2>👨‍💻 Your Mission (Step-by-Step)</h2>

    <p>Follow these commands one by one, or else face the wrath of the Git Gods. 🔥✨</p>

    <div class="command-box">
        1. <strong>Fork this repo</strong> (click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page). No, it’s not a in this page, go to <a href="https://github.com/sathsarabandaraj/nibm-git-demo.git">Github. </a><br>
        2. <strong>Clone the repo</strong> to your local machine:
        <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git</code><br>
        3. <strong>Create your personal index file</strong> and name it like this: 
        <code>your-university-index.html</code>. No, "cool-file.html" will not do. This isn’t high school, be creative.<br>
        4. Add your fun content (name, university, something that will make us laugh – or cry, we’re flexible). 🎨<br>
        5. <strong>Add the file</strong> to the `html-files/` folder. Don’t mess with other files, it’s like walking into someone’s house and rearranging their furniture.<br>
        6. <strong>Commit your changes</strong>:
        <code>git add html-files/your-university-index.html</code>
        <code>git commit -m "Add my university index page! (And I swear I didn't break anything else)"</code><br>
        7. <strong>Push your changes</strong>:
        <code>git push origin main</code><br>
        8. <strong>Open a pull request</strong> to the original repo! 📬 Be sure to double-check your changes. No one likes surprises unless they’re in the form of cake.<br>
        <em>Remember: No messing with other people's files. They’re not your toys. 🚫 Git Gods are watching!!!!</em>
    </div>

    <h2>🚨 IMPORTANT RULES 🚨</h2>
    <p>Let’s make sure we don’t turn this into a disaster. Follow these rules closely, or risk being banished to the land of infinite merge conflicts (seriously, it’s a nightmare). 😱</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Don't mess with anyone else's files!</strong> Keep your hands to yourself, unless you're touching your own file. If you touch someone else's file, Git Gremlins will come after you. 👹</li>
        <li><strong>2. Name your file like this:</strong> <code>your-university-index.html</code>. Don’t name it “final_v4_fixed_v2_reallyfinal.html” – that’s how you summon chaos. 🌀</li>
        <li><strong>3. One file, one PR:</strong> If you add 10 files or change anything unrelated to your page, you'll find yourself in a deep pit of merge conflicts. You have been warned. 😈</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now go ahead, fork this project, clone your fork, and add your creative touch to the <code>html-files/</code> directory! You’re not just contributing to this repo – you’re contributing to the chaos of the open-source world! 🌍🔥</p>

    <footer>
        <p>⚡️ Pro Tip: Commit often, push early, and always, ALWAYS make sure your pull requests are cleaner than your room. If you're unsure, Git's got your back (and so do we). 🙌</p>
        <p>Remember: Git is like a box of chocolates — you never know what merge conflicts you'll get. 🍫 But if you mess up, we have a secret stash of chocolate to bribe you with. 🍬</p>
